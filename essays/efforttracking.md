Throughout the course of building our final project, my team and I participated in effort estimation and tracking. In doing so, this allowed us to have an idea of how long each of our issues would take and when we would need to delegate time to work on them. In turn, we can also see how long it took a specific member of our team to complete an issue and from there, we can then adjust our efforts accordingly either for other issues, or another milestone. Completing this has allowed us to be sure we’re all on the same page and putting in a fair amount of work, while also seeing that if someone may be taking a lot of time and effort towards one issue, we can offer to help them and alleviate the stress and amount of effort it would take from one person alone. 

Since our project utilized a lot of similar features as Digits, the majority of my estimations were based on how long it took me to implement similar things during Digits. For example, I remember having issues with the contact collection since we already had “Contacts” and i got really confused between the two, so when it was time to implement “StudySession” i was sure to estimate more time since I had already experienced a difficult time implementing the contact collection. I also based it on if it was something that I’d did before, even outside of Digits. If the concept was completely new to me, I added more hours to the estimation just because I knew I would need to look for examples or techniques that I could use to help implement them. Sometimes estimations were obvious as well, for example, one of my issues for Milestone 3 was to double check that everything worked after deployment, which doesn’t require the same amount of effort as implementing a new page or something similar, so I only listed the estimation as 10 minutes max. Sometimes, issues were also rolled over into other milestones as revisions of the first version since we had ran out of time or couldn’t figure it out the first time around, so for those, I also allotted for time in the estimation since I already knew it was something that I struggled with the first time around.


 Making estimates in advance was beneficial to me because I could plan out my homework schedule easier. Since I had an idea of what issues would take me the most amount of time, I was able to plan better in terms of getting assignments done and could properly focus on all of my classes instead of just this project. It also helped to see if my classmates thought their issues would take longer, then it was easy for me to jump in and ask if they’d like help so the amount of work is fair and they can also allot their time for other assignments besides this one. 


I believe that actually tracking the effort for each issue was important because it allowed us to see how much effort that took us and we can build off of that time if it’s something we’d like to be able to do quickly, similarly to WODs. It’s also important so we can all have an idea of how much effort all of us are individually putting into our areas of the project to ensure everything is decently fair, and no one is doing more work than others. 

I tracked my effort using the Intellij plugin as well as starting a timer on my computer, similar to the ones we used for WODs, except with a time constraint. I’d say my times are pretty accurate other than the fact that I rounded up since putting something like 22.389 seconds is a little ridiculous, but only to the nearest whole number. The other thing that would impact my times are the pockets of breaks I take while working on homework that often include going on my phone or taking a YouTube break and forgetting to pause my timer. Even at that, my breaks are usually only 10-15 minutes, so the tracking should be accurate. I also believe Intellij keeps the timer on as long as you’re in the editor so I chose to use the times I timed personally, since my intellij once told me I spent 20 hours on something which was unrealistic.
