Students at UH Manoa may encounter difficulties while studying, doing homework, or with their overall academic performance. There are a number of reasons why a student may be struggling, such as personal challenges or rigorous coursework, but one common issue is not having the proper resources to seek help.

Our application, Manoa Mentoring, aims to bring together students and mentors. Students can match themselves with other students who are facing similar issues, or they can choose a mentor who specializes in a subject or course they are taking. Through Manoa Mentoring, our goal is to create a space where students can not only receive the support they need, but also foster connections through mentorship and potential friendships.
